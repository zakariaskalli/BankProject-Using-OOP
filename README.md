# 🏦 Bank Management System – Console App (C++ | OOP | Clean Code)

## 🔹 Description

This is a fully functional **Bank Management System** developed as a **Console Application using C++**, designed with a strong focus on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and **Clean Code** practices.

The goal of the project is to simulate a real-world banking environment, covering complete **CRUD operations** using **file-based data storage**, with well-structured modules and layered logic.  
The application was originally built using a functional programming approach and later refactored into a fully OOP-based architecture, showcasing my learning journey and deeper understanding of software design.

  - Add / Update / Delete / Find Clients
  - Unique Account Numbers and PIN Codes
  - Show full client list with balances and contact info
- 💳 **Transactions Module:**
  - Deposit / Withdraw / Transfer
  - Total Balances calculation
  - Transfer logs stored with timestamps and user data
- 👥 **User Management:**
  - Add, Edit, Delete, and Search Users
  - Role-based access control using **binary flags**
- 🕓 **Login Register:**
  - Logs every login with timestamp, username, and permissions
- 💱 **Currency Exchange System:**
  - View, search, and update exchange rates
  - Built-in currency conversion calculator
- 🧪 **Validation & Tests:**
  - Business rule validations (e.g., cannot transfer with insufficient balance)
  - Robust error handling and input validation

## 🔹 Technologies & Concepts Used

- **C++** (Console Application)
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
  - Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism
- **File I/O** for persistent storage (no database used)
- **Clean Code:** Modular design, clear naming, logical separation
- **Bitwise Permission System** (binary access control)
- **Functional Programming** (in the initial version)
- **Custom layered architecture**

## 🔹 Why This Project Matters

This project goes beyond a basic CRUD demo — it’s a **realistic simulation of core banking operations**, built entirely in **low-level C++** without external libraries or frameworks.

It demonstrates:
- Strong command of data structures and memory management
- Manual implementation of layered architecture
- Deep understanding of logic handling, access control, and business flow
- Real-world practices applied in a console environment

> Every part of the system is handcrafted for **learning**, **accuracy**, and **clean code principles**.
